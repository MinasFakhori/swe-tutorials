They are added automatically after a user types in the password. Salts are stored in plain text with the hash output so the website knows what salt to use.</p>

                    <p class ="ans">This model is extremely secure as only one person can decide who has access to what. But is more complex and is hard to scale because you have to keep changing which subject have access to the object.</p>

                    <p class ="ans">A model of access control. Every object has an owner, the owner has full control of who can access or modify the object. The admin can access the file even if the owner didn't give permission.</p>
                    <p class ="ans">This is the easiest to use and to implement. The issue is it doesn't scale well because it will have so many different owners and so many different files to give access to.</p>

                <div class="qbox">

                    <h3>What is ABAC (Attribute based access control)?</h3>

                   <p class = "ans">Ths gives you more granular control over who can access the file but is more complex as you have to set up a number of attributes for each person.</p>

                    <p>The relationship between all three is that it keeps the system secure by having access control policies in place to keep the systems confidentiality, integrity and availability .</p>

                <h3>What is a hash?</h3> 
                <p class = "ans">A mathematical function that changes a text into a random output string that has fixed length. The same input string will always produce the same output string, if the input string is changed by a single charter the output string will be completely different.</p>  
                <p class = "ans">Hash is a one way encryption, you cant decrypt it.</p>
                <h3>How can you decode a hash?</h3>
                <p class = "ans">Because hashes always produce the same output string, by comparing to the database of the common passwords, you can reverse engineer what the password was. This is called a rainbow table.</p>

                <h3>Substitution cipher</h3>

                <p>This is when shift the letters in an alphabet a certain amount to encrypt the message. Eg Lets shift minas 3 letters this would give me plqdv. To decrypt it you apply the sift.</p>
                <p>This can be cracked because each language has a frequency for each letter for eg in the uk the letter e is the most common letter used. To break it you count the frequency of each letter and check how far the shift has shifted. This is called frequency analysis.</p>
                <p>It can also be cracked by brut force as their are only 25 keys.</p>

                <h3>Types of encryption</h3> 
                <p class = "ans">Symmetric encryption - <strong>only private key.</strong> You use the same key to encrypt and decrypt. This processes text into fixed block sizes. E.g, DES, 3DES, AES. The issue is you need to securely swap the keys. This is faster than asymmetric encryption, and their isnt a size limit of the message.</p>  
                <p class="ans">Asymmetric encryption - A public and a private key. The public key can be distributed freely. The key used to encrypt is different to the key used to decrypt. The person encrypts an outgoing message using the receivers public key, but only the receivers private key can decrypt it. This can be used for digital certification and SSL. Its slow and has a message size limit, but it is safer.</p>

                <p class = "ans">Bugs and logic flaws are the main causes of vulnerabilities. To protect against them you need to have different testing and development teams, a fresh pair of eyes can help spot new issues. Assessment process for unknown vulnerabilities. Automated and manual tools should be used. The use of coding standards and practices. </p>

                <h3>What is manual code review?</h3> 
                <p class = "ans">This is when someone deep dives into the code to see if there are any vulnerabilities. They check for logic errors and things automatic code review tools might not be able to find. There are tools that help with manual code review for example to make reading the code easier or to be able to comment. This requires extra time as it isn't done automatically.</p>

                        <li>High impact honeypot - A real system with a full OS, services and apps. Its a more realistic target that may take an attacker longer to work out that it is a fake system.

                    <p class = "ans">They could exploit a software vulnerabilities to add malware. This could be done on the host or on the network, a worm could then replicate</p>

                    <p class = "ans">A virus is a program that infects other programs by changing them maliciously.</p>
                    <p class = "ans">Virus distinguishing features include:</p>
                    <ul class ="ans">
                        <li>Reproduce its own code</li>
                        <li>Attaches itself to other files (cant survive by itself)</li>
                        <li>Spreads when the executable file is executed</li>
                        <li> They thrive on lack of user authentication and access controls thats why they were so dominant in the early days.</li>

                        <li>Trigger/Logic bomb - The event that causes it to activate the payload</li>

                    <h3>What are Macro and scripting virus</h3> 
                    <p class = "ans">These are usually exploited in microsoft office or a official app that lets you run mini code. The attacker runs malware in that mini code, this can be done through a word document or excel that usually spread through a phishing email and gets you to click enable macros, by enabling the macros you allow the documents to run malware. Macros are stored as visual basic code or XLM so it is easily for a hacker to put malicious code on it, to do things like execute a power shell command or download a malware. XLM its harder for antivirus to detect because the technology is so old. Because macro viruses infect user documents rather than system programs, traditional file system access controls are of limited use in preventing their spread.</p>

                <div class="qbox">
                    <h3>What are worms</h3> 
                    <p class = "ans">A program that tries to infect more machines. To replicate itself a worm needs access to systems like email, file sharing, reverse shell or team viewer. It has the same phase as the virus. The propagation phase tries to find access to other systems to infect.</p>
                    <p class = "ans">After a worm gets in a system, it goes to the network and spread once it finds other systems it infects them. Everytime a system connects to a new network the process repeats.</p>

                <div class="qbox">
                    <h3>Bots and botnets</h3> 
                    <p class = "ans">A bot is a machine that is controlled by an attacker remotely. They dont have to affect the system it takes some system resources to mine crypto or for a DDOS attack. It is usually a larger network of bots and their is a master bot that controls what the system does.</p> 
                    <p class = "ans">The attacker controls the Command and Control server (C&C) server, all bots contact the C&C and report their status and receivers commands.</p>
                    <img class = "normal_images" src="images/botnet.png" alt="sercuriyterminolgy">
                    <p class ="ans"> The issue with the C&C is the it provides a single point of failure. To prevent that most attackers have multiple C&C servers. Large botnets usually are broken up into smaller once so each bot only knows one C&C server. </p>
                    <p class = "ans">Their are two approaches to C&C which are:</p>
                    <ul class ="ans">
                        <li>Push style - botmaster sends command to the bot.</li>
                        <li>Pull style - bot asks master for commands</li>
                    </ul>


                    <p class = "ans">Address for each C&C server must be available to each bot this includes binary, config and must be frequently updated.</p>
                </div>


                <div class="qbox">
                    <h3>What is DOS attack?</h3> 
                    <p class = "ans">Denial of service this is when a devices floods the network/website with traffic, making it slow or unaccessible.</p>
                    <p class = "ans">This dosnt work as much any more because servers got good at handling a lot of traffic.</p>

                    <p class = "ans">This requires you to run the program but it can't self replicate.</p>
