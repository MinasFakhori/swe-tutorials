# Docker Ignore

This will ignore files that we don't need when coping while building the docker image. For example we don't want a node_modules folder. 

To do this make a `.dockerignore` file and specify and file or folder we want docker to ignore  

e.g., 

`touch .dockerignore`

`vim .dockerignore`

```bash
node_modules

*.md

```
Anything that ends with .md
