# Volumes

Volumes allow you to share data from and to the host to the docker container. 

So if there is a change in the host computer, you get the change on the Docker container without having to rebuild it, and the same thing applies to the other way round. 

The image dosn't change when you have the file change, it just maps directories between containers and the host. 

To do this you map the path in the host to the docker container by using the `-v` flag. 

`docker run --name the_name -d -p 8080:8080 --rm -v host/path:/app myapp`

what if you want to share everything apart from for example the node_modules as if you delete it on your local machine docker will not be able to run

you can add another volume that maps to it self.

Overrides the previous volumes but only for the node folder

`docker run --name the_name -d -p 8080:8080 --rm -v host/path:/app -v /app/node_modules myapp`


### Forgot to do volumes? 

Let's say you used the docker container to generate a file and you want to transfer it back to the host machine how do you do that? 

`docker cp container_name:docker_path host_path`

### Other way? 

What if you are running something on the container and then realise that you are missing a file how do you add it from host to container 

`docker cp host_path container_id:container_path
`
