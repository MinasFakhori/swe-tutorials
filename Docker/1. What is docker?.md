# What is docker?

**Before using this tutorial please have docker already installed. If you don't  click [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)**

Docker that allows us to package, distribute, and run applications within containers. 

Containers are standalone software packages (like a box) that include everything needed to run an application, such as code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.

The docker container can run independent of your system, away from any processes on the computer.  

The difference between VM and Containers is: 
- VM has its own full OS (has its own kernel), whereas containers share the host's OS
- VM are usually slower, containers are usually quicker
- Containers use a slimmed down version of an OS but shares the kernel.
