### Docker Compose

This allows you to build and run multiple docker images, this uses a yaml format

To start make a new file called docker-compose.yaml
`touch docker-compose.yaml`

1. `verison`, Specify the version of docker compose (time of writing it's 3.8)

	```yaml
	version:"3.8"
	```

2. `services`, This is the different docker project that you want to build, this is usually the repo name e.g., api. 

	2.1 `build`This is the location of the Dockerfile
	
	2.2 `container_name` This is the name of the container
	
	2.3 `ports` you can also specify the port 
	
	2.4 `volumns`


	```yaml
	services:
		api:
			build: ./api
			container_name: api_container
			ports:
				- '4000:4000'
			volumes:
				- './api:/app'
				- './app/node_modules'

	```



### Running the docker compose
