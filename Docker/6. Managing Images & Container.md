# Managing Images & Container

### Managing Images

To view all the images you can use `docker images`

To remove an image you use `docker image rm img_name`

If an image is being used by a container even if it's not running you will get an error if you want to remove it to force remove it, type: 

`docker image rm img_name -f`

### Managing Containers

To list all the running containers type: 
`docker ps`

To list all the running and non running containers type: 
`docker ps -a`

To remove a container, type:
`docker container rm name`

To remove after a docker run you add a `--rm`:
`docker run --name app -d -p 8080:8080 --rm img_name`
